Try it now!

You can try now the [example "Todo application" live](http://resthub.org/todo/) and [take a look at the code](https://github.com/resthub/todo-backbone-example).

[Reference documentation](http://resthub.org/) is available for both Spring and Backbone stacks.

Feel free to contact us on [RESThub discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/resthub-dev) if you need help or want to send us some feedbacks.

The rationale behind RESThub 2.0
--------------------------------

RESThub is all about **integrating and bundling frameworks with tools, best practices and documentation**. The RESThub team works everyday with those frameworks on high traffic, enterprise-grade applications for their customers.

That's why **we value developer experience** on those libraries and despise the "Not Invented Here" syndrome above all.

RESThub is a two-part web framework: you can use the JavaScript stack part with a Ruby-on-Rails or Node.js backend; or you could use the Java stack with an Angular.js frontend!

We strongly believe in Open Source Software, so the whole thing is available under the Apache License 2.0 on [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.resthub%22) and [Github](http://github.com/resthub/).

Roadmap
-------

Expected new features for upcoming RESThub 2.1 are :
 - Uprade to Spring 3.2
 - Upgrade to Backbone.js 1.0
 - Bean Validation + Backbone Validation plugin : do not duplicate your validation anymore on client side
 - RESThub Identity manager : User/Group/Role webapp with Backbone.js GUI (alpha version available [here](https://github.com/resthub/resthub-identity))
 - ElasticSearch integration
 - Websocket support
 - Improved Exception to HTTP response mapper (JSON/XML serialization of i18n aware messages)
 - More examples applications

Contributions and feedbacks are welcomed !!!
